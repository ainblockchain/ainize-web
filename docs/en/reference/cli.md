title: CLI reference
summary: Every `ainize` command, argument and option, generated from the CLI's own declarations
---

# CLI reference

> [!NOTE]
> **This page is generated — do not edit it by hand.** It is written by `scripts/docs-gen.mjs` from `packages/cli/src/bin.ts`.
> Regenerate with `npm run docs:gen`; `npm run docs:check` fails when this page and the source disagree.

Every command the `ainize` CLI accepts — 29 top-level commands, 91 of them runnable — with the arguments, options, defaults and examples each one declares. The binary is also installed as `ngram`; the two names run the same program.

## How to read this page

Each command shows the shape of the line first: required arguments in `<angle brackets>`, optional ones in `[square brackets]`, a trailing `…` where several values may follow, and every required option spelled out. `[options]` stands for the rest of the list below it.

An option with a type takes a value (`--limit 20`); a `boolean` option is a flag, and `--no-` in front of its name turns it off — `ainize init --no-force`.

The global options come first because they work everywhere; everything after that is one command per heading, nested exactly as its subcommands are.

## Global options

These are accepted by every command.

- **`--home`** (`string`) — node home directory (AINIZE_HOME)
- **`--node`** (`string`) — node API URL (default: http://localhost:\<config port>)
- **`--json`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — machine-readable JSON output — one document per command, errors included, on failure to stderr
- **`--quiet`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — print nothing but the id of whatever was created or changed
- **`--wide`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — do not fit tables to the terminal width (piped output is never fitted)
- **`--help`, `-h`** (`boolean`) — print the help for a command and exit
- **`--version`** (`boolean`) — print the CLI version and exit

- **`--private-key`** (`string`) — import an existing AIN private key (hex)
- **`--public-url`** (`string`) — URL peers can reach this node at
- **`--host`** (`string`) — interface to bind (default 127.0.0.1 — this machine only)
- **`--public`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — bind 0.0.0.0 (every interface) — only behind a firewall or proxy
- **`--password`** (`string`) — operator password, set now so nobody else can claim this node (or AINIZE_PASSWORD)
- **`--no-password`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — leave the node unclaimed; `ainize login` claims it later (loopback only)
- **`--force`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — rewrite an existing config.json (the node identity and operator password are kept; the old file is copied aside)
- **`--new-identity`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — with --force: mint a NEW node key, orphaning everything the old one published (asks you to type the current address)

**Examples**

```bash

- `ainize patch buy` — Buy listed knowledge via HTTP 402 (x402) and download the body — several ids buy them in the order given
- `ainize patch price` — Change what a published knowledge sells for (0 makes it free)
- `ainize patch download` — Collect a knowledge this node already paid for — no second payment

- `ainize patch missing` — Open questions: what people asked this knowledge that it could not answer
- `ainize patch signals` — How a knowledge is doing: network facts, and this node's last 30 days
- `ainize patch conflicts` — Address-set overlaps with other patches
- `ainize patch records` — Ledger records about a patch

```bash
# resolve, peer, log in, quote, pay, download, load
ainize patch vaults.defi.engram.eth
# just show where the name points
ainize patch vaults.defi.engram.eth --resolve-only

- **`--kind`** (`"extend" | "contradict" | "update" | "merge"`) — what this is to --parents: extend (adds answers on top) · contradict (disagrees with some of theirs) · update (your own next version) · merge. Needs the base's file on this node, which is how the row counts are measured
- **`--force`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — publish bytes this node already published on this subject, or for a model it cannot test (never another author's bytes)
- **`--test`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — hidden test listing (not shown in public catalogs)

- **`--price`** (`string`) — price if you later publish it (default: this node's market.defaultPrice)
- **`--license`** (`string`) — licence for the draft: an SPDX id or free text
- **`--description`** (`string`) — one or two sentences about what it knows
- **`--drop-lineage`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — import as a ROOT even though the lesson names a base this node does not have — no credit and no royalty to the base creator

ainize patch announce krx-codes-v3 --supersede krx-codes-v2
# today replaces yesterday even though their rows do not overlap
ainize patch announce krx-codes-2026-09-04 --supersede krx-codes-2026-09-03
# a dated snapshot that retires nothing
ainize patch announce krx-snapshot-2026-09-01 --keep-others
```

### `ainize patch retire`

```bash
ainize patch retire <id> [options]
```

Take your published knowledge off sale for good (the record stays; buyers keep their copy)

**Arguments**

- **`<id>`** (`string`, required)

**Options**

- **`--reason`** (`string`) — why, in one line — shown to anyone who asks for it afterwards

- **`--as-of`** (`string`) — the day the DATA is true of (YYYY-MM-DD) — not the day it is published. Shown as "Data as of …" and sorted by `--sort fresh`
- **`--topic`** (`string`) — ain-js knowledge topic path (e.g. finance/krx); default: patches/\<model>

- **`--keep-others`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — with --announce: retire nothing — every overlapping listing of yours stays on sale
- **`--kind`** (`"extend" | "contradict" | "update" | "merge"`) — what this is to --parents: extend (adds answers on top) · contradict (disagrees with some of theirs) · update (your own next version) · merge. Needs the base's file on this node, which is how the row counts are measured
- **`--force`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — publish bytes this node already published on this subject, or for a model it cannot test (never another author's bytes)
- **`--test`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — hidden test listing (not shown in public catalogs)
- **`--announce`** (`boolean`, default `true`) — announce immediately — the permanent record, and the one step with no undo (--no-announce keeps a draft, which is what `ainize patch publish` does by default)

- `ainize dataset get` — The training set of a knowledge — what it is, and with -o the questions themselves

### `ainize dataset get`

```bash
ainize dataset get <id> [options]
```

The training set of a knowledge — what it is, and with -o the questions themselves

Also spelled `ainize dataset download`.

**Arguments**

- **`<id>`** (`string`, required) — knowledge id (`ainize patch ls`) or the sha256 of the training set

**Options**

- **`--key`** (`string`) — teaching key (64-hex) — or AINIZE_TEACH_KEY
- **`--key-file`** (`string`) — the key backup JSON from the browser (ainize-teaching-key-….json); default: \<home>/teaching-key.json, created on first use
- **`--out`, `-o`** (`string`) — write the questions to this file (.jsonl — re-uploadable with `ainize teach dataset <file>`)
- **`--manifest`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — also print the manifest: row origin, licence, benchmark hash, PII scan, declaration
- **`--include-notes`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — keep the publisher’s per-row notes in the written file (they are left out by default)

```bash
# access, licence, where it came from, and the first questions
ainize dataset get krx-all-2761

ainize dataset get krx-all-2761 -o questions.jsonl
```

## `ainize use`

```bash

- **`--yes`, `-y`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — skip the confirmation (answer yes in advance)
- **`--max-price`** (`number`) — refuse if the total for one knowledge (it + the bases it needs) is above this
- **`--bundle`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — buy the bases this knowledge needs underneath it too (one payment each). Without it you are asked

```bash
# quote, ask, pay, download, load
ainize use krx-all-2761

- **`--patch`, `-p`** (`string`) — knowledge to load together, comma-separated (up to 3, in load order; the last wins where they overlap)
- **`--mode`, `-m`** (`"base" | "patched" | "compare"`, default `"compare"`) — base = model only, patched = with the patch loaded, compare = both
- **`--thinking`** (`boolean`, default `false`) — let the model think first and show its reasoning

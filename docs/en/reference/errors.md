What an error body looks like, how a thrown error becomes an HTTP status, and the 60 codes a client can match on.

## The error envelope

Every failed request answers with `{"error": "<message>"}` and one of the statuses below. Some errors add fields to that object; the endpoint that raises them says so in the [HTTP API reference](./http-api.md).

Where the message begins with a lower-case word and a colon — `dataset_not_found: no such dataset on this node` — **that prefix is the machine-readable code**. There is no separate `code` field: match on the prefix, show the sentence.

### How a thrown error becomes a status

| Error | HTTP status | Also in the body |
|---|---|---|
| `ChatCancelledError` | `499` | `cancelled`, `charged` |
| `Error` whose message matches `/shared runtime busy/` | `503` and the header `retry-after: 30` | `busy` |
| `TeachError` | the error's own status | `(err.details ?? {})` |
| `HttpError` | the error's own status | `err.body` |
| `PayoutError` | the error's own status |   |
| `z.ZodError` | `400` | `issues` |
| `ValidationError` | `400` |   |
| `ConflictError` | `409` | `(err.details ?? {})` |
| `NotFoundError` | `404` |   |
| `MarketError` | the error's own status | `(err.details ?? {})` |

Anything else is a fault in the node and comes back as `500` with the raw message.

## Codes

60 codes are raised by name, in 118 distinct messages: a code that can come back with more than one status, or with more than one sentence, has a row for each. An ellipsis or a `<name>` in a sentence is a value filled in at the time — the code before the colon is the part to match on.

## Messages without a code

Not every error carries a code. 45 raise a plain sentence and are told apart by their status — these are written for a person reading them, so match on the status, never on the words.

A further 27 throw sites build their message at the time (a validator's own wording, a peer's answer); they answer with the statuses above.
